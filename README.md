=======================
###### avgTempPlot.R
  > plots school day/hour temperatures for input classrooms 
  
    1. averaged by month and time for all observations
    2. averaged by month and time for observations where outside temperature is above "minTemp"
    3. on the day where the maximum temperature differential occurs, for each month
    
###### avgDiffPlot.R
  > plots school day/hour temperature differences for like clusters of classroom comparisons
  
    1. averaged by month and time for all observations - average difference overlayed on individual comparisons
    2. averaged by month and time for observations where outside temperature is above "minTemp"
